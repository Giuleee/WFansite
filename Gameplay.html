 <h1>Gameplay </h1>
 <p>There are a few types of different missions the player can enbark on such as assault missions, defence missions, survival missions.
    There's open world too where the player can choose a bounty containing 4-6 different objectives which need to be completed so that 
    the player can get a reward from the reward pool. There are missions in space, where the player flies a ship, or Archwing 
    (jetpacks that look like wings). There are story missions, and the story is really interesting and captivating. There are also 
    side objectives and faction missions too and last but not least invasion missions.
