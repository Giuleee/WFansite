        <h1>Factions in the game</h1>
    
        <p>The Grineer is one of the major Factions of the Origin System.They are the first enemies encountered by newly reawakened Tenno.
            The expansion of their militaristic, violent Empire across the Origin System through the raiding or conquest of peaceful colonies
            serves as the primary motivator of the Lotus' call to her slumbering warriors. <br>
    <br>
            The Corpus, also known as the Taxmen, are a conglomeration of plutocratic ocmmercial and industrial interests unified by a single
            trade language and a common goal - the pursuit of wealth and Profit through the development and sale of advanced technologies
            and through the rediscovery of lost artifacts from the Orokin Era, including Warframes themselves and Sentients.They are the second
            enemy faction encountered by the player. Their arsenal is a potent mix of energy weapons and robotic troops. Many Tenno have made 
            the mistake of firing at a Corpus Crewman's head only to have the bullet deflected, and many have fallen to the close-in charge of
            a MOA's plasma barrage. <br>
            <br>
            
            The Infested are a multitude of deformed, twisted creatures, originated from the mutation of normal living beings who have been
            taken over by the techno-organic parasites of the <i>Infestation</i>, a biomechanical pathogen created by the Orokin. The majority
            of Infested are former Corpus Crewmen or Grineer Lancers, or "Mutalist" versions of Corpus robotic proxies. The eldest individuals, 
            the Infested Ancients, are creatures overtaken by the plague so long ago that their original form is unrecognizable, perhaps dating
            back to the Old War itself.<br>
