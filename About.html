        <h1>About the game</h1>
        <p>Warframe is a 2013 free-to-play science fiction cooperative third person shooter video game both developed
            and published by Digital Extremes for Microsoft Windows,Xbox one,Playstation 4,Xbox Series X/S,Playstation 5,
            Nintendo Switch, and was previously available within GamersFirstLive.

            Warframe is set in a distant future where the solar system is dominated between the Grineer, an empire race of 
            millitarized clones; the Corpus, a mega-corporation merchant cult with advanced robotics and laser technology;
            and the Infested, the name for a disease and its victims that devours all. The players takes the role of a Tenno, an
            ancient warrior created by the Orokin to battle a mysterious foe but left to slumber generations ago, until woken by
            and entity called the Lotus for the sole purpose of reuniting the scattered,war-tron colonies throughout the system.
            The players are always pitted against enemies in superior numbers. To this end, players have at their disposal a varied
            arsenal of weapons both archaic and modern,and most notably, their most powerful weapon-the titular Warframe,each of which
            has a oartucykar set of abilities. Despite being primarily a shooter game, the gameplay has a definite focus on the 
            synchronization of players' arsenal, allowing for limitless creativity in combat.
