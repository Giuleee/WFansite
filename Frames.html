        <h1>Waframes</h1>
        <p>There are over 16 warframes in total (Basic Warframe and its Prime part)<br>
            The Warframe is an advanced weapons system used exclusively by the Tenno in their missions throughout the Origin System.
            The Warframes possess regenerative shields, greatly enhanced mobility, and the use of an array of supernatural abilities - 
            all of wchich further augment the Tenno's deadly use of traditional combat arts.<br>
            <br>
             <i>The true nature of the Warframes and their Tenno connection is a secret lost to the Old War. Together, they represent our best
                hope in turning the tide of the machine war. Warframes are unique from Dax and other infantry, deploying dangerous and esoteric Void
                energy, and equipped with often mundane physical weapons- this is key to fighting an enemy that had turned our technology against us.<br>
