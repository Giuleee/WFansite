    <h1>Waframe</h1>
    <p>
        <b> Waframe is a free to play shoot and loot style type of game equivalent, if not better, than Destiny2.
        Whith thousands of people playing it daily. It has a great, friendly and helpful community, 
        which in my opinion are one of the lead things that kept the game from closing down. 
        Except for the community, Warframe has managed to make the trading system one of the best there is.
        Free to play players can farm hard to acquire and/or rare mods to sell on the marketplace for 
        Platinum (the VIP currency) which is obtainable by buying it, or by trading for it ofcourse.
        So after playing 2000+ hours of this game here is what i've learned and my experience with it.
